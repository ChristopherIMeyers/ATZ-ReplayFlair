#Flair

The flair system is fully automated.  Before messaging the moderators with issues, please read the instructions and read through this FAQ.  Most problems can not be solved by a moderator but can be solved by you.

##Instructions to get league flair in the subreddit

1. host a custom game by yourself (no other players, no bots)
2. click "resume game" if it pops up
3. type out in chat "reddit name: <redditname>"
4. score screen/end game
5. upload the replay of that game to [ggtracker](http://ggtracker.com/) ~~or [drop.sc](http://drop.sc/)~~ ([drop.sc is not currently supported](https://github.com/ChristopherIMeyers/ATZ-ReplayFlair/issues/14)) 
6. message atzbot with the url of the uploaded replay [like so](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=atzbot&subject=account%20link%20replay&message=http://ggtracker.com/matches/123456789)



##FAQ

> ###What is league flair?

User flair is a way to customize your username on a subreddit.  Not all subreddits use it, and they can be used in many different ways.  The way we use it on AllThingsZerg is we let you show off what league you are in (like so http://i.imgur.com/Rkom4C6.png).  When you mouse over a user you will be informed of his region and his battle.net name and character code.

> ###My flair isn't working!

Have you sent the message to Automaton in step 6?  Be sure to give the system a few minutes to process your request before trying again.

> ### I sent the message but I didn't get my flair!

Have you received a reply (may take a few minutes)?  If you have waited and heard nothing, but sure that your message subject is titled "account link replay" exactly (no quotes).

> ##I got an error message

Most of the error messages are pretty self explanatory.  If you have trouble the first time because your replay was invalid, try again with a new replay and send another message to Automaton.  If the message is crypt or confusing, feel free to [send us a message](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAllThingsZerg) and we can work it out.


> ### What is going to happen to my old master league flair?

All old manually verified flair will be retired in a process that has already begun.  Flair will be retired based on the season it was setup, (more recent master league flair will not be retired as quickly)

> ### What happens if my league changes?

The system will automatically update your flair after your promotion or demotion.

> ### What about multiple regions?

The flair system only supports a single region so you will have to pick one.  If you change your mind about what region you want to represent, you can go through this process again with a different region and it will update everything for you (overriding your old information)

> ### What about the other subreddits?

I am open to letting them use my battle.net thread, my data, or my bot, but I don't have access to the other subreddits directly.  After you go through this process you will not currently get any new flair on any other subreddit.  If you are a mod of another subreddit, feel free to [message me](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=jo3m3tal) and I can help you set it up if you would like league flair on your subreddit.

> ### Why drop.sc?

I just picked one (also the urls are neat).  I'm open to supporting other replay sites, I just haven't done it.  If you would like your site to be supported, send us a message and let us know.

> ### I want a new feature or have some other idea about how to change something
